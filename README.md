# Click_and_collect_App
*"Café chez Gaëlle"* is a business that has decided to set up a Click and Collect feature as well as a showcase site to promote and develop its activity.

The project therefore had two objectives:
- First, set up a showcase site that presents the business and its activities as well as its events.
- Then set up a Click and Collect application so that customers can pick up their products faster and with less contact during the pandemic. Users of the application can therefore select products and follow the progress from order preparation to receipt.
